# Optimizing Herding Efficiency: A Multi-Agent Simulation Study on finding the Optimal Number of Shepherds for Herding Large Flocks
This project presents a study on the herding problem, which involves controlling a large group of autonomous agents using a small number of shepherding agents. We develop a simulation environment to test approaches for the dog behavioral model using the unicycle model. Our goal is to investigate the optimal number of dogs for different herd sizes using metrics such as herd cohesion, distance of the center of the herd from the goal, and time needed to converge to the goal. The results of our study will help to determine the most effective approach for controlling herds and inform applications such as sheep-dog herding, crowd control, and protecting certain areas.We present a detailed description of our simulation environment, the experimental setup, and the results obtained from our study. Our findings indicate that the optimal number of dogs depends on the size of the herd and the desired level of herd cohesion. We also discuss the limitations of our study and suggest future research directions for the herding problem.
